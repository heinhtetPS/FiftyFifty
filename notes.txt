todo general
- server call is returning correct data
- now make the frontend execute the call and see the data
- make sure you can make 20 calls in a row OR space them out a little and load
-


server
- currently the query response appears on the server logs but not the page
- hopefully this will translate ok to the frontend 

frontend
- Questions and MainFrame have to adhere to a larger State variable (maybe)
- Score Tracker
- State tracks end of game and displays end thing
- Different questions have to cause different pieces of data to not be displayed
